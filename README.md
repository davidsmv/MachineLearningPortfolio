# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! This repository serves as a compilation of projects and exercises I've undertaken to deepen my understanding and skills in machine learning. Each project is a reflection of what I've learned and showcases different aspects and techniques of machine learning.

## Introduction

A brief introduction about yourself, your background in machine learning, and what motivates you to pursue machine learning projects. You can also mention the courses, books, or resources that have influenced your learning journey.

## Projects Overview

An overview of the projects included in this portfolio. You can organize this section by topics, technologies, or complexity. Briefly describe what each project aims to solve or explore.

### Project 1: [Project Name]

- **Description:** A short description of what the project is about, the problem it aims to solve, and the dataset(s) used.
- **Technologies and Techniques:** List the technologies (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn) and machine learning techniques (e.g., regression, classification, neural networks) employed in the project.
- **Results:** Highlight the key results, findings, or insights gained from the project.
- **Link to Project:** `[Project Folder](link-to-project-folder)`

### Project 2: [Project Name]

- Repeat the structure above for each project.

## Skills Acquired

A list of skills and knowledge areas you have developed through these projects. This could include specific machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation methods, programming languages, and libraries.
