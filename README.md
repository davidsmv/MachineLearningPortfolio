# Machine Learning Portafolio

## Overview
This repository contains various personal machine learning projects, primarily developed in Jupyter notebooks. The projects are categorized based on machine learning techniques such as linear regression, classification, and clustering. Each project is self-contained and includes data analysis, model training, and predictions.
